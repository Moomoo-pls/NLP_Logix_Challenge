Description: You will need to pull down this repository, as it contains the CSV necessary to run challenge 1 as well as the virtual environment.
        
        The dependencies for this package are provided in the virtual environment associated with this repo.
        Meaning, there's no need to pip install anything for this to run, you can just source NLP_Logix_Challenge/bin/activate
        Everything has already been installed locally into the virtual environment provided.
        Once the virtual environment is activated, you can then just run the files as console commands.
        
        
        challenge-1 will require you to be in a directory that has the challengeCSV directory and Appeals_Filed_In_2017.csv file in that directory.
        The repository has this by default, but if you were wanting to run this command anywhere else, you could copy the directory elsewhere.
        
        challenge-4 will generate the CSV in the current directory you are calling it from.
        challenge-5 will generate the html in the current directory you are calling it from.
